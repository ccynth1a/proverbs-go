# Proverbs

# NOTE: After Migrating my personal website to Svelte this no longer works. Might change that at some point

Hi! This isn't really meant to be any sort of project, it's just a simple program I've produced in my first day learning Go. As mentioned in the description, it's a clone of the UNIX command Fortune, using various Chinese proverbs I have found.

For a first day project I'm happy with it, but I'm sure in a couple months I'll be questioning how I thought any of this was sane.
